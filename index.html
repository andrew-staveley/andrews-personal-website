        <h1>Welcome to Andrew's Wesbite!</h1>
        <h3>This is a website dedicated to Andrew so he can practice his coding.</h3>
        <p> This is just a paragraph that I am adding for content, so I can <span style="color: coral;">mess around</span> with it with CSS.</p>
        <p> I'm not sure what else to write here so maybe I'll add a picture of a penguin or something cool like that. I'm really tempted to add the <span style="color: forestgreen; font-weight: bold;">SHREK</span> movie script but I'm not sure if a real person will see this or not.</p>

                <h3>Lmao Shrek Script, sorry it's playing right now in the background.</h3>

                <p>Once upon a time there was a lovely 
                    princess. But she had an enchantment 
                    upon her of a fearful sort which could 
                    only be broken by love's first kiss. 
                    She was locked away in a castle guarded 
                    by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. 
                    Many brave knights had attempted to 
                    free her from this dreadful prison, 
                    but non prevailed. She waited in the 
                    dragon's keep in the highest room of 
                    the tallest tower for her true love 
                    and true love's first kiss. (laughs) 
                    Like that's ever gonna happen. What 
                    a load of - (toilet flush)

          day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go 
          after the ogre.</p>
